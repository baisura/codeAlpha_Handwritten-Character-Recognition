‚úçÔ∏è Handwritten Character Recognition Using Deep Learning
This project builds a handwritten character recognition system using CNN (Convolutional Neural Networks). It recognizes digits (0-9) and letters (A-Z, a-z) from handwritten input and can be extended to recognize full words or sentences.

üîπ Key Steps:
1Ô∏è‚É£ Dataset ‚Äì Uses MNIST (digits) or EMNIST (characters).
2Ô∏è‚É£ Preprocessing ‚Äì Converts images to grayscale, resizes, and normalizes.
3Ô∏è‚É£ Model ‚Äì CNN-based architecture for feature extraction.
4Ô∏è‚É£ Training & Evaluation ‚Äì Achieves >98% accuracy.
5Ô∏è‚É£ Real-Time Prediction ‚Äì Recognizes handwritten input using OpenCV.
